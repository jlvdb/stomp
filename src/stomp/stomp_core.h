// STOMP is a set of libraries for doing astrostatistical analysis on the
// celestial sphere.  The goal is to enable descriptions of arbitrary regions
// on the sky which may or may not encode futher spatial information (galaxy
// density, CMB temperature, observational depth, etc.) and to do so in such
// a way as to make the analysis of that data as algorithmically efficient as
// possible.
//
// This header file contains the basic constants necessary to make the library
// function and should be included in any program using the library.

// chosen such that the width of one pixel matches the fiducial width of a
// stripe in the SDSS survey coordinates.
//
// Pixels are addressed hierarchically, so a given pixel is refined into 4
// sub-pixels and is joined with 3 nearby pixels to form a superpixel.  The
// level of refinement is encoded in the "resolution" level, with the
// following two functions defining the limits on acceptable values (basically
// limited by the number of pixels that can be addressed in a single
// superpixel with 32-bit integers).  The current limits allow for about
// half a terapixel on the sphere, which corresponds to roughly 2 arcsecond
// resolution.  Valid resolution values are all powers of 2; refining the
// pixel scale increases resolution by a factor of 2 at each level and
// coarsening the pixel scale reduces the resolution by a factor of 2 at each
// level.
