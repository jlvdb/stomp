// STOMP is a set of libraries for doing astrostatistical analysis on the
// celestial sphere.  The goal is to enable descriptions of arbitrary regions
// on the sky which may or may not encode futher spatial information (galaxy
// density, CMB temperature, observational depth, etc.) and to do so in such
// a way as to make the analysis of that data as algorithmically efficient as
// possible.
//
// This header file contains a variant on the Pixel class.  The goal here is to
// encode some manner of scalar field (galaxy density on the sky, CMB
// temperature, etc.) where we need both the value and an associated noise on
// the value.  Likewise, as will be seen in the ScalarMap class, these pixels
// will generally be used to sample this scalar field uniformly over some
// region.  This is in contrast with the Map object where the goal is to
// accurately describe a region's geometry using pixels of various sizes.

  // In order to do correlation function calculations, we need some
  // functionality beyond the normal Pixel object.  In particular, we want
  // to be able to encode fields, which may take one of three forms:
  //
  // * Pure scalar quantities (e.g. CMB temperature or radio flux).
  // * Point-field densities (e.g. the projected galaxy density over some area).
  // * Point-sampled averages (e.g. the mean galaxy magnitude over some area).
  //
  // In order to accomodate those three cases, we need an extra float and
  // an extra int (the Weight() value in Pixel will encode the fraction of
  // the pixel area that's contained in the survey area).  Pixels are taken
  // to be units of a Map where the geometry of the map is the union of all of
  // the Pixels and the Pixels are not assumed to be at the same resolution
  // level.  ScalarPixels, OTOH, form the basis for ScalarMaps where the
  // map is taken to be a regular sampling of some field over a given area.
  // The total area for the map can be calculated, but operations like
  // determining whether or not a given position is inside or outside the
  // map is not generically available.
