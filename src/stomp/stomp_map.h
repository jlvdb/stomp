// STOMP is a set of libraries for doing astrostatistical analysis on the
// celestial sphere.  The goal is to enable descriptions of arbitrary regions
// on the sky which may or may not encode futher spatial information (galaxy
// density, CMB temperature, observational depth, etc.) and to do so in such
// a way as to make the analysis of that data as algorithmically efficient as
// possible.
//
// This header file contains the Map class.  Maps are intended to describe an
// arbitrary area on the sky as precisely as possible, given the limits of
// pixel resolution, physical memory, etc.  Internally, this information is
// encoded using pixels at a range of resolutions, depending on how the
// boundaries of the area in question and the pixelization scheme interact.
// However, the goal of the class is to abstract away those details, allowing
// the user to treat Maps as a pure representative of spherical geometry.
