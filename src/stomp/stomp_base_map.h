// STOMP is a set of libraries for doing astrostatistical analysis on the
// celestial sphere.  The goal is to enable descriptions of arbitrary regions
// on the sky which may or may not encode futher spatial information (galaxy
// density, CMB temperature, observational depth, etc.) and to do so in such
// a way as to make the analysis of that data as algorithmically efficient as
// possible.
//
// This header file contains the abstract BaseMap class that serves as the
// basis for all of the *Map objects.  BaseMap sets out the basic functionality
// that all of the *Map classes need to describe a given region on the sky and
// do some basic internal maintenance.  Additionally, BaseMap provides a
// common set of methods for dividing that area up into nearly equal-area,
// similarly-shaped regions.  This functionality is the basis for calculating
// jack-knife errors for our various statistical analyses.
